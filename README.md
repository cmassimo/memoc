A genetic algorithm to solve the ATSP
=====================================

Assignment project for the Combinatorial Optimization course.

The goal of this project is to approximate an exact solution (dir 1-simplex) to the asymmetric 
traveling salesman problem by the means of a genetic algorithm (dir 2-ga) and gain a
significant computational advantage while maintaining comparable performance results.
