# Metodi e modelli per l'ottimizzazione combinatoria (Assignment)
This project contains the code for the assignment of the combinatorial optimization course.
The goal of this project is to approximate an exact solution (dir 1-simplex) to the asymmetric 
traveling salesman problem by the means of a genetic algorithm (dir 2-ga).
